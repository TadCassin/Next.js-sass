            The process of growth and development almost never seems to manage to create this subtle balance between the importance of the individual parts, and the coherence of
            the environment as a whole.

            In an organic environment, every place is unique, and the different places also cooperate, with no parts left over, to create a global whole - a whole which can be
            identified by everyone who is part of it.

            Making simulations of what you're going to build is tremendously useful if you can get feedback from them that will tell you where you've gone wrong and what you can do

            To work our way towards a shared language once again, we must first learn how to discover patterns which are deep, and capable of generating life.

            From a sequence of these individual patterns, whole buildings with the character of nature will form themselves within your thoughts, as easily as sentences.

            self-maintaining fire which is the quality without a name.
