              A study exploring the relationship between literacy levels and the French Revolution of 1789 suggests that literacy may have played a role in the extent and nature of
              peasant revolts.

                    There is a clear correlation between low literacy rates and higher rates of crime. Individuals with low literacy are less likely to fully understand and follow
                    laws, leading to a higher likelihood of getting into trouble with the law.

                    Low literacy rates can lead to poor academic performance. In the United States, for example, 4 in 5 adults are literate, but literacy rates have not improved
                    over time, revealing that US schools continue to underperform.

                    Low literacy can also impact health outcomes. Individuals with low literacy may have limited ability to make important informed decisions, such as understanding
                    government policies, reading medicine or nutritional labels, and more.

                    Lower literacy rates directly correlate to higher unemployment rates, reduced income, and overall impacts on competitiveness on the global stage 1 . Illiteracy
                    and low levels of literacy can lead to welfare dependency, lower self-esteem, and higher levels of crime.

                    across all elementary-school students.
